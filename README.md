# Alternative Writing Standard for C++

This is a coding convention I'm developing based on my believes and likings when writing personal code.
I mostly code in C++ so it's mainly for it. Im not sure how well it will translate to other languages.

Please know that I do not have work experience, nor have I followed any conventions.
So what I'm writing here is pure and solely from my experience.

It may leave you with something to think about, or worst case you'll get a good laugh out of it.
Either way it won't be a waste of time, so read it, criticise it, or laugh at it.
Heck why not all, just promise me to tell it straight to my face.
